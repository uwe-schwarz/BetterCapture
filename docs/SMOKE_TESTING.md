# Manual Smoke Testing Strategy

This document outlines the manual testing matrix for BetterCapture. These tests focus on hardware interactions, visual verification, and edge cases that are difficult to automate.

## Test Coverage Summary

### Meeting Recording

| Test Case | Settings | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static meeting video | 1 fps, H.264 or HEVC, system audio and microphone | A readable video with one frame per second, including more than 10 seconds of unchanged content and the final static tail; both audio tracks retain their full duration |
| Fixed screenshots | Screenshots, Fixed Interval, 2 seconds | A session folder with timestamped PNGs every 2 seconds, even while the selected window stays unchanged; no video track |
| Changed screenshots | Screenshots, Only Changes, 1 second | First image saved; repeated images and small cursor movement ignored; a new slide and a return to the first slide both saved |
| Document edits | Only Changes; a bright document plus a small camera tile | Text changes saved; movement confined to the camera tile usually ignored |
| Screenshot audio | Screenshots with system audio, microphone, both, then neither | Enabled sources become separate tracks in audio.mov; no audio file when both sources are disabled; timestamps match the audio timeline |
| Source and error handling | Screenshots, window/area/display; stop sharing or interrupt the source | Correct content and resolution; no stale images while unavailable; completed images and finalized audio survive a write failure |
| Settings persistence | Switch output modes and restart | Mode, interval, and screenshot policy persist; previous video codec and HDR choices remain available when returning to video |

## Testing Notes

### Prerequisites

- macOS 15.2 or later
- Screen Recording permission granted
- Microphone permission granted (for audio tests)
- Built-in and external display (for multi-monitor tests)
- HDR-capable display (for HDR test)
- Test content with transparent windows (for alpha test)
- HDR video content (for color verification)

### Test Execution Guidelines

1. Run tests in order to catch regressions early
2. Verify output files play correctly in QuickTime Player
3. Check file properties match expected codec/container
4. Use QuickTime Inspector (⌘I) to verify:
   - Video codec and resolution
   - Audio tracks and codec
   - Frame rate
   - Color profile (for HDR)
   - Alpha channel presence
5. Delete test files between runs to avoid confusion
6. Document any failures with console logs and system details

### Known Limitations

- HDR recording requires HEVC, ProRes 422, or ProRes 4444 (H.264 does not support HDR)
- Alpha channel requires HEVC or ProRes 4444 with MOV container
- PCM audio requires MOV container
- MP4 container supports H.264/HEVC only, no alpha
- Area selection requires minimum 24pt size
- Native frame rate follows the display but is capped at 60 fps
- Application capture renders at display size, showing only the selected app's windows over the
  wallpaper and Dock. Turning off both Show Wallpaper and Show Dock gives the app on black.
- Window and application captures record system audio through a second, full-display stream, so
  audio is never scoped to the selected content
